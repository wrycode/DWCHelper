This repository holds source code for my 2019 Undergraduate Research
and Creativity Award project, which is a collaborative effort with the
Anthropology department at UNCG. 

The eventual goal of the project is to provide a tool for researchers
at different sites in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania to easily share,
compare, and combine datasets and create useful, publishable data
visualizations.

Currently, we're focused on building a simple tool to format datasets
for [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) compatibility, called
DWCHelper.

In June of 2019, I will be traveling to Tanzania to excavate and
analyze animal bones, and I hope to gain a broader understanding of
the context surrounding these 1.4 to 2 million-year-old specimens. My
objective is to understand what types of questions researchers may
need answered in their quest to understand this period of human
evolution.
